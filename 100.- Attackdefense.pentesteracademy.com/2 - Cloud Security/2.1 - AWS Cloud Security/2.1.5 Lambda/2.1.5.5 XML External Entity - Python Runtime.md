Serverless Architecture is said to be more secure compared to traditional architectures. However, this does not mean attacks cannot be performed on it.Â 

In this lab, we will learn how a vulnerable lambda function can be leveraged to perform an XXE attack and read files from the running container  

**Objective:** Exploit the XXE vulnerability and retrieve the content of /etc/passwd file.
